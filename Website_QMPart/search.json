    "text": "Exercise A – Vibrational spectroscopy using nuclear wave functions\nwith \\(\\mu\\) being the associated reduced mass. However, a short-coming of this approach is the neglect of anharmonicity, mode coupling and nuclear quantum effects. In some cases these contributions cancel, while for other systems the error in the harmonic frequencies can be up to \\(300\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}\\).\nAn elegant alternative is the calculation of vibrational wave functions by numerically solving the nuclear Schrödinger equation. One method to achieve this is a method according to Boris V. Numerov requiring the potential curve as input in form of a discretised grid. The latter can be obtained from a potential energy scan executed for instance using the QM program gaussian. The difference between the eigenvalue of the ground state (\\(n=0\\)) and the first (\\(n=1\\)) and second (\\(n=2\\)) excited states correspond to the expected vibrational frequency of the fundamental and first overtone, when divided by Planck’s constant:\n\\[\n\\nu_{n0} = \\frac{E_n - E_0}{h}\n\\]\nFrom the frequencies \\(\\nu_{n0}\\) (in \\(\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\)) the respective wave numbers \\(\\bar{\\nu}_{n0}\\) (in \\(\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\\)) have to be calculated and reported. Knowledge of the wave function also enables the calculation of the oscillator strengths \\(f_{n0}\\), providing an accurate estimate of the expected IR absorption intensities.\n\\[\nf_{n0} = \\frac{4\\pi m_{\\mathrm{e}}}{3\\mathrm{e}^2\\hbar c}|\\mu_{n0}|^2 \\bar{\\nu}_{n0}= 4.702 \\cdot 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{\\frac{cm}{D^2}}|\\mu_{n0}|^2 \\bar{\\nu}_{n0}\n\\]\nTo calculate the oscillator strength, the wave numbers \\(\\bar{\\nu}_{n0}\\) and the respective transition dipole moment \\(\\mu_{n0}\\) is required. The latter is given as:\n\\[\n|\\mu_{n0}|^2 = |\\mu_{n0}^x|^2 +  |\\mu_{n0}^y|^2 + |\\mu_{n0}^z|^2\n\\]\nwith\n\\[\n|\\mu_{n0}^x| = \\left &lt; \\psi_0 | \\mu^x | \\psi_n \\right &gt; = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi_0 \\mu^x \\psi_n dx\n\\]\nWhile this integral appears intimidating, it can be easily evaluated in an approximate way using the trapezoidal rule:\n\\[\n\\int_a^b f(x) dx \\approx \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} (y_1 + 2y_2 +2 y_3+ ... + 2y_{n-1}+y_n)\n\\] \\[\n\\approx \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (y_i + y_{i+1})\n\\]\nThe calculation of the trapezoidal integration is actually very simple and can be easily implemented in a spreadsheet editor such as libreoffice or excel (or computed using data science software such as matlab, octave,python, R, etc.)",

It is not possible to simple use the associated values to calculate the frequency without first making the units compatible: \\[\n\\nu = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}\n\\]\n\nHere, the units \\(\\mathrm{kcal}\\), \\(\\mathrm{Å^{-2}}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{g}\\) need to be converted to obtain the unit of \\(\\mathrm{s^{-1}}\\) for the frequency.",

    "text": "Exercise B - NNP MD Simulations of H2@ZIF-8\n\n Metal-organic framework (MOFs) are hybrid crystalline materials assembled from both inorganic and organic residues containing potential voids [1]. The key advantage of MOFs over naturally occurring porous compounds such as zeolites (i.e. alumino- silicates) or polymers lies in their crystalline nature, which allows for systematic modification through crystal engineering principles by altering their organic linkers or metal nodes. This capability leads to an almost limitless number of possible framework topologies, making them particularly appealing for technologically relevant applications.\nOne of the most widely discussed applications is associated to the enormous gas storage capacity of MOF materials. Storage and separation of critical green house gasses such as CO2 and CH4 are widely discussed [2,3]. In addition, MOFs have also emerged as highly promising candidates for the storage of molecular hydrogen as a green energy carrier [4] (due to their ultrahigh surface area, tunable pore dimensions, and rapid kinetics for hydrogen adsorption and desorption).\nAn increasing number of MOF compounds are discussed as potential hydrogen carrier [4]. In this exercise, H2 storage in the comparably simple ZIF-8 (zeolitic imidazolate framework) is investigated via molecular dynamics simulations (MD), to keep the computational effort and memory demand manageable.\nThe ZIF-8 system Zn(methylimidazolate)2 crystalizes in a cubic unit cell (space group no. 217, I43m ) with a lattice parameter of approx 1.7 nm. The cubic unit cell contains a total of 12 Zn2+ ions that are tetrahedrally coordinated by the 24 methylimidazolate linkers. The pore structure of ZIF-8 is similar compared to the topology of a prototypic sodalite zeolite (hence the name zeolitic imidazolate framework). Several studies have indeed investigated ZIF systems with respect to their hydrogen storage capacity [5-8].\nIn order to achieve fast and accurate MD simulations, the MACE-MP neural network potential (NNP) is applied. If trained properly, NNPs provide an efficient and versatile description of a chemical system, that combines the advantages of quantum chemical and force field descriptions.\nIn this exercise the properties of the pristine host material (lattice parameter, thermal expansion coefficient) and the associated host-guest interaction (interaction energies, diffusion coefficent, activation energy of diffusion) will be analyzed.\n\n[1] Yusuf, V.

We can say that in the linear regime we fulfill this limes due to unchanging slope which represents the difffusion coefficient.\nTherefore it is important to have really linear behaviour in order to apply the Einstein relation.\nYou get the slope by fitting a linear regression at the last linear section.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.optimize import curve_fit\nimport matplotlib as mpl\n\nmpl.rcParams[\"font.size\"] = 15\nmpl.rcParams[\"axes.labelsize\"] = 20\n\ndata = np.genfromtxt(\"../data/diff.out\")\nsteps = data[:,0]\ntime = steps*0.002\nMSD_x = data[:,1]\nMSD_y = data[:,2]\nMSD_z = data[:,3]\nMSD_xyz = MSD_x + MSD_y + MSD_z\n\ndef ballistic_regime(x,a):\n  return a*x**2\n\ndef superdiffusion(x,a):\n  return a*x**1.5\n\ndef subdiffusion(x,a):\n  return a*x**0.5\n\ndef normaldiffusion(x,a):\n  return a*x\n\ndef confined_diffusion(x,a,b):\n  return a*(1-np.exp(-b*x))\n\ndef linear_regression(x,a,b):\n  return a*x + b\n\npopt, pcov = curve_fit(linear_regression,time[-500:],MSD_xyz[-500:])\n\nd_einstein = popt[0]/6\ntime_regime= np.linspace(0,10,1000)\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2,1,figsize=(4,8),gridspec_kw={'hspace': 0.4})\naxs[0].plot(time,MSD_x,label=r\"$MSD_x$\",color=\"C0\")\naxs[0].plot(time,MSD_y,label=r\"$MSD_y$\",color=\"purple\")\naxs[0].plot(time,MSD_z,label=r\"$MSD_z$\",color=\"grey\")\naxs[0].plot(time,MSD_xyz,label=r\"$MSD_{x+y+z}$\",color=\"k\")\naxs[0].vlines(time[-500],0,500,color=\"k\",linestyle=\"dotted\",label=r\"fitting regime\")\naxs[0].plot(time[-500:],linear_regression(time[-500:],*popt),color=\"red\",linestyle=\"dashed\",label=r\"linear fit $y=a\\cdot x + b$: $a= {:.2f}$, $b= {:.2f}$ \".format(popt[0],popt[1]))\naxs[0].text(-0.5, 1.05, '(a)', transform=axs[0].transAxes, fontsize=14, verticalalignment='top')\naxs[0].text(1.0,400, r\"$D_s=%2.2f\\,\\mathrm{\\AA^2 ps^{-1}}$\" %(d_einstein),fontsize=14)\naxs[0].legend(fontsize=12,loc='upper left', bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1.05))\n\n\naxs[1].plot(time_regime,ballistic_regime(time_regime,100),label=r\"ballistic regime $\\propto \\tau^2$\", color=\"gold\", linestyle=\"dashed\")\naxs[1].plot(time_regime,superdiffusion(time_regime,100),label=r\"superdiffusion regime $\\propto \\tau^{\\alpha}, \\alpha&gt;1$\", color=\"darkred\", linestyle=\"dashed\")\naxs[1].plot(time_regime,normaldiffusion(time_regime,100),label=r\"normal diffusion regime $\\propto \\tau$\", color=\"red\", linestyle=\"dashed\")\naxs[1].plot(time_regime,subdiffusion(time_regime,100),label=r\"subdiffusion regime $\\propto \\tau^{\\alpha}, \\alpha&lt;1$\", color=\"salmon\", linestyle=\"dashed\")\n\naxs[1].plot(time_regime,confined_diffusion(time_regime,50,2),label=r\"confined diffusion regime $\\propto$ const.\", color=\"hotpink\", linestyle=\"dashed\")\n\n\naxs[0].set_xlabel(r\"correlation time $\\tau$ in ps\")\naxs[0].set_ylabel(r\"$MSD(t)$ in $\\mathrm{\\AA^2}$\")\n\naxs[0].set_ylim(0,500)\n\n\naxs[1].set_xlabel(r\"correlation time $\\tau$ in ps\")\naxs[1].set_ylabel(r\"$MSD(t)$ in $\\mathrm{\\AA^2}$\")\naxs[1].set_xlim(0,5)\naxs[1].set_ylim(0,500)\naxs[1].text(-0.5, 1.05, '(b)', transform=axs[1].transAxes, fontsize=14, verticalalignment='top')\n\naxs[1].legend(fontsize=12,loc='upper left', bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1.05))\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: (a) MSD(t) plot, (b) diffusion regimes",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThis guide is for people new to Linux. The aim of this documents is to help with everyday challenges when working with Linux systems. Generally, manual pages (e.g. man sed gives the terminal manual of sed) are almost everytime helpful and also -h (or --help) flags after commands quickly display helpful information. Obviously, the internet often helps as well and most of the time new things are learned doing. A good overview of the command line interface on linux is on the following github repository (there is also a german version, but reading the english one is recommended):\nhttps://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line\n\n\nProbably most used linux commands:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommand [options]\ndescription\n\n\n\n\ncd /path/to/directory | Change to directory\n\n\nmkdir [options] directory\nCreate a new directory\n\n\ntouch filename\nCreate an empty file with the specified name\n\n\ncp [options] source destination\nCopy files and directories\n\n\nmv [options] source destination\nRename or move file(s) or directories\n\n\nls [options]\nList directory contents\n\n\npwd\nDisplay the pathname for the current directory\n\n\nrm [options] directory\nRemove (delete) file(s) and/or directories\n\n\nrm -r [options] directory\nDelete directories\n\n\ncat [filename]\nDisplay file’s contents to the standard output device\n\n\nless [options] [filename]\nView the contents of a file one page at a time\n\n\ntail [options] [filename]\nDisplay the last n lines of a file (the default is 10)\n\n\nhead [options] [filename]\nDisplay the first n lines of a file (the default is 10)\n\n\ngrep [options] pattern [filesname]\nSearch files or output for a particular pattern\n\n\nchmod [options] mode filename\nChange a file’s permissions (u+x to make executable)\n\n\nfind [pathname] [expression]\nSearch for files matching a provided pattern.\n\n\nsort [options] file\nsort the file via [option]\n\n\nps [options]\nDisplay a snapshot of the currently running processes\n\n\ntop\nDisplays the resources being used on your system. Press q to exit\n\n\nkill [options] pid\nStop a process. If the process refuses to stop, use kill -9 pid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore commands are:\n\n\nBasic Linux Commands (modified version of source: here)\n\n\ncommand [options]\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nman [command]\nDisplay the help information for the specified command\n\n\necho [options]\nPrint string, variable, etc.\n\n\ntar [options] filename\nStore and extract files from a tarfile (.tar) or tarball (.tar.gz or .tgz)\n\n\nbc\nbasic calculator (e.g. echo “3+2”| bc \\(\\;\\) gives 5 for floats use flag -l)\n\n\nchown [options] filename\nChange who owns a file\n\n\nclear\nClear a command line screen/window for a fresh start\n\n\ndate [options]\nDisplay or set the system date and time\n\n\ndf [options]\nDisplay used and available disk space\n\n\ndu [options]\nShow how much space each file takes up\n\n\nln [options] source [destination]\nCreate a shortcut.\n\n\nlocate filename\nSearch a copy of your filesystem for the specified filename.\n\n\npasswd [name [password]]\nChange the password\n\n\nssh [options] user@machine\nRemotely log in to another Linux machine, over the network\n\n\nwho [options]\nDisplay who is logged on\n\n\n&gt; [oufile]\nWrite stdout (text written to terminal) to outfile (e.g. dftb+ &gt; dftb.out)\n\n\n\n\nYou can use Tab for autocompletion of commands.\nCommands can usually be combined with the pipe: |. To write a pipe press Alt Gr + &lt;|&gt;-key (usually located on the left of Y on German keyboards) in between. For example:\n    grep \"Done\" dftb.out | cat -n     \nTo send your job to the background, stop it with CTRL+Z and then enter bg. Afterwards, you can logout with CTRL+D and the process will still be running (can be observed with top when relogging in) after you closed the terminal.\nOn the desktop computers in the office you can search the history with PageUp and PageDown keys. The prefix you entered will then be autocompleted by searching in the history for matching commands you entered before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you want quick access to files or directories in your home folder, the ~-symbol is an alias for your home directory /home/user (= \\$HOME).\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to: edit files\nFor editing files you can use any editor that you like e.g.:\n\nVSCode (code)\nnedit\ngedit\nEmacs (emacs)\n\nFor quick changes in files vim is a good option as it runs in the terminal (no -X in ssh required). To learn the basic commands the vimtutor (just type \"vimtutor\" in your terminal) is highly recommended. To exit vim, just type :q and Enter.\n\nVim cheat sheet\n\n\n\nHow to: gawk\nBasic usage of gawk:\ngawk '{ [commands] }' file\nExample: print the first and third column of the file example.dat. Be sure to add some spaces in between the columns using \"   \":\ngawk '{print $1\"   \"$3}' example.dat\nExample: print the first column and \\(500*x^2\\) of the first column column of the file x.dat to calculate a harmonic potential and output then data to the file potential.dat:\ngawk '{print $1\"   \" 500*$1*$1}' x.dat &gt; potential.dat\nFor more advanced usage, also printf and if/else statements can be used similar in the language C. And sed (see below) can be used to substitute characters with white spaces which then generate new columns that can be printed with gawk.\n\n\nHow to: sed\nBasic usage of sed:\nsed -flags '[commands]' file\nExample: every occurrence (g for global at the end) of \"apple\" in fruit.dat will be substituted (s at the beginning) by \"banana\":\nsed 's/apple/banana/g' fruit.dat\nTo extract lines between two strings (print every line between \"pear\" and \"kiwi\"), use:\nsed '/pear/,/kiwi/p' fruit.dat\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that symbols, numbers, words, strings can be replaced with a white space (\" \") to separate columns which can be printed with gawk. The combination of sed and gawk is very powerful!\n\n\n\n\nHow to: for-loops in bash\nA simple for loop looks like:\nfor i in [list]\n    do \n    [commands]\n    done \nFor every item in [list] the commands between the lines do and done will be executed. For example to print all the items in the fruit list:\nfor i in pear banana apple\n    do \n    echo $i\n    done \nor print a sequence of numbers (here 1-10):\nfor i in $(seq 1 1 10)\n    do \n    echo $i\n    done \nor iterate over output files (here grep for the Total Energy of a QM calculation):\nfor i in $(ls *.out)\n    do \n    grep \"Total Energy\" $i\n    done \n\n\nHow to: ssh & scp\nNote the ~ symbol is an alias for /home/\\$USER where \\$USER is your username. To connect with a remote pc via ssh (no colon!)\n\nssh username@remote_host  \nTo enable streaming of windows (e.g. nedit) to your computer add -X (when accessing from home, -CY might be faster and more stable):\nssh -X username@remote_host  \nCopy file from a remote host to local host (your computer):\nscp   username@from_host:one_file.txt   some/folder/\nCopy file from local host (your computer) to a remote host:\nscp   one_file.txt   username@to_host:/some/folder/\nCopy directory from a remote host to local host:\nscp -r   username@from_host:/some/folder/    other/folder/\nCopy directory from local host to a remote host:\nscp -r   some/folder/   username@to_host:/other/folder/\nThe use of rsync is recommended. See:\nhttps://www.tecmint.com/rsync-local-remote-file-synchronization-commands/\nTo login into remote computers without password authentication run ssh-keygen (just press Enter a few times) and ssh-copyid $USER@$HOST and enter the password.
