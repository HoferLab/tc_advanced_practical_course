How to learn programming
========================

- A good free option to learn python is [`python` for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/)
- [Excersim](https://exercism.org/) offers programming challenges (various languages) 
Udemy courses have a good reputation as well.




Python Tutorial
================

Welcome to the `python` tutorial! In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of the `python` programming language, including variables, data types, loops, and functions.

Variables
---------

In `python`, a variable is a container that holds a value. To create a variable, you simply assign a value to it using the assignment operator (=). For example:

```python
x = 5
```

This creates a variable called `x` and assigns it the value `5`. You can then use the variable `x` in your code to refer to the value `5`.

Data Types
----------

`python` has several built-in data types, including:

* Integers: whole numbers, like `5`
* Floats: decimal numbers, like `3.14`
* Strings: sequences of characters, like `"hello"`
* Booleans: values that can be either `True` or `False`

You can use the `type()` function to check the data type of a variable. For example:

```python
x = 5
print(type(x)) # Output: <class 'int'>
```

Loops
-----

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. In `python`, there are two types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.

`For` loops are used to iterate over a sequence of values, such as a list or a string. For example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
  print(fruit)
```

This will output each fruit in the list, one at a time.

`While` loops are used to repeat a block of code while a certain condition is true. For example:

```python
x = 0
while x < 5:
  print(x)
  x += 1
```

This will output the numbers `0` through `4`, one at a time.

Functions
---------

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. To define a function in `python`, you use the `def` keyword followed by the name of the function and a colon. For example:

```python
def greet(name):
  print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

This defines a function called `greet` that takes a single argument called `name`. You can then call the function using the name of the function followed by parentheses containing any arguments. For example:

```python
greet("Alice") # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

This will call the `greet` function with the argument `"Alice"`, which will print the message "Hello, Alice!".
