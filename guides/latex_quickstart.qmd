How to: LaTeX
=============

- [A Short Introduction to LATEX](http://www.math.uco.edu/pages/rwilliams/math3183-fall2018/Short_LaTeX_Intro.pdf)
- [The Not So Short Introduction to LATEX 2$_\epsilon$](https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf)
- [Overleaf Documentation](https://de.overleaf.com/learn)
 A list of LaTeX editors:\

-   TeXStudio

-   Kile

-   Any texteditor with a LaTeX plugin (*e.g.* VScode, (neo)vim, Kile, ...)

-   [Overleaf](https://de.overleaf.com/) (online tool) - it is not recommended if you want to compile a very large project like a thesis because it is getting very slow.
