## Gaussian geometry optimization {.unnumbered}
Example input for a geometry optimisation. It is important to include **one (and only one) blank line**  after the command line (#-line), the title-line as well as the atom list and at least one blank-line after the last input.

## Gaussian frequency calculation {.unnumbered}
Example input for a frequency calculation. It is important to include **one (and only one) blank line**  after the command line (#-line), the title-line as well as the atom list and at least one blank-line after the last input.

:::{.callout-note}
# Reminder:
Frequency computations work **only(!)** at minimum geometries! \
Method and basis set have to be same for optimisation and frequency calculation!

## Gaussian potential energy scan {.unnumbered}

Example input for a potential energy scan. It is important to include **one (and only one) blank line**  after the command line (#-line), the title-line as well as the atom list and at least one blank-line after the last input.

A suitable starting value for the scan has to be provided, based on the bond distance obtained from the minimum geometry. For example in the case of HCl:

:::{.callout-note icon=false  }
1.29056384Å – 0.5Å = 0.79056384Å
:::



:::{.callout-note}
# Reminder:
In this exercise the scan has to be at the minimum geometry!
Method and basis set have to be same for optimisation and frequency calculation!
**Be sure to scan the correct bond (not always B1!).**

## Gaussian frequency calculation for DCl {.unnumbered}

Example input for a frequency calculation for DCl. It is important to include **one (and only one) blank line**  after the command line (#-line), the title-line as well as the atom list and at least one blank-line after the last input.

:::{.callout-note}
