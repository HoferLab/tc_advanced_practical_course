Here are some poster templates:

- [UIBK Poster template](https://www.uibk.ac.at/de/public-relations/services/dokumentvorlagen/)
- [Overleaf Templates](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/poster)

Think about how to create the poster. Figures and tables should be informative and readable. Choose a suitable font size and style. Divide the poster in reasonable sections.
