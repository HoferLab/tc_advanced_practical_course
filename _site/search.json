    "text": "Exercise - NNP MD Simulations of CO2@ZIF-8\n\n Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are hybrid crystalline materials assembled from both inorganic and organic residues containing potential voids [1]. The key advantage of MOFs over naturally occurring porous compounds such as zeolites (i.e. aluminosilicates) or polymers lies in their crystalline nature, which allows for systematic modification through crystal engineering principles by altering their organic linkers or metal nodes. This capability leads to an almost limitless number of possible framework topologies and properties, making them particularly appealing for technological applications.\nOne of the most widely discussed applications is associated to the enormous gas storage capacity of MOF materials. Storage and separation of critical green house gases such as CO2 and CH4 are widely discussed [2,3]. In addition, due to their ultrahigh internal surface area, tunable pore dimensions, and rapid kinetics for gas adsorption and desorption, MOFs have emerged as highly promising candidates for capturing and storing carbon dioxide, called direct air capture (DAC) [4].\nAn increasing number of MOF compounds are discussed as potential host matrices for green house gases [4]. In this exercise, carbon dioxide storage in the comparably simple ZIF-8 (zeolitic imidazolate framework) is investigated via molecular dynamics simulations (MD), to keep the computational effort and memory demand manageable.\nThe ZIF-8 system Zn(2-methylimidazolate)2 crystallizes in the non-centrosymmetric cubic space group I43m (space group no. 217) with a lattice parameter of approx 1.7 nm. The cubic unit cell contains a total of 12 Zn2+ cations that are each tetrahedrally coordinated by four 2-methylimidazolate linkers. The pore structure of ZIF-8 is similar to the topology of a prototypic sodalite zeolite (hence the name zeolitic imidazolate framework). Several studies have investigated ZIF systems with respect to their CO2 storage capacity [5-8].\nIn order to achieve fast and accurate MD simulations, the MACE-MP neural network potential (NNP) [9-11] is applied, in particular the MACE-DAC-1 model [12], which is trained not only on solid-state systems but also on interactions with gases for direct air capture (DAC) applications. If trained properly, NNPs provide an efficient and versatile description of chemical systems, combining the accuracy of high level quantum chemical methods with the speed of classical force field approaches.\nIn this exercise the properties of the pristine host material (lattice parameter and thermal expansion coefficient) and the interaction between the inserted CO2 molecules and the ZIF-8 host (interaction energies, diffusion coefficient, activation energy of diffusion) will be studied.\n\n[1] Yusuf, V.

    "text": "Preanalysis\nFirstly, in order to obtain meaningful physical properties from a simulation, it is essential to ensure that the system is in an equilibrium state. However, what constitutes an equilibrium state?\nOnce these properties fluctuate around a constant pattern without any long-term trends, it can be assumed that the system reached an equilibrium state.\nThe thermal expansion coefficient is a quantity that describes the extent to which a solid substance undergoes a change in size in response to variations in temperature.\nTherefore the system is computed in the \\(NPT\\) ensemble at different temperatures \\(T_i\\) at \\(1\\,\\mathrm{bar}\\).\nIn our case we consider a temperature range from \\(248\\,\\text{to}\\,348\\,\\mathrm{K}\\) in \\(25\\,\\mathrm{K}\\) steps.\nThe linear thermal expansion coefficient at \\(\\mathrm{298}\\,\\mathrm{K}\\) is calculated from the temperature gradient of the respective average lattice parameter \\(\\left < a \\right >\\), \\(\\left < b \\right >\\) or \\(\\left < c\\right >\\) at constant pressure \\(P\\) (\\(NPT\\) ensemble). \\[\n\\alpha _{x}^{T_{\\mathrm{298\\,K}}} = \\frac{1}{x} \\left ( \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial T} \\right ) _{P}, x={a,b,c}\n\\] The slope can be estimated numerically in different ways. A simple way is to employ a finite difference method. There are three fundamental types of finite differentiation: forward, backward and central finite differentiation.\nWe will use the central finite difference method with a five-point stencil. In general it is formulated in 1D as: \\[\nf'(x) = \\frac{-f(x+2h)+8f(x+h)-8f(x-h)+f(x-2h)}{12 h} + \\frac{h^4}{30}f^{(5)(c)}, c \\in [x-2h,x+2h]\n\\] where \\(h\\) is the change of \\(x\\).\nIf you use more than five points, a higher order stencil can be used.\nIn our case the differentiation can be written as: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial T} \\approx \\frac{ \\left < x^{T_{\\mathrm{248\\,K}}}\\right >-8 \\left < x^{T_{\\mathrm{273\\,K}}}\\right > + 8 \\left < x^{T_{\\mathrm{323\\,K}}}\\right > - \\left < x^{T_{\\mathrm{348\\,K}}} \\right > }{12\\Delta T}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\alpha _{V}^{T_{\\mathrm{298\\,K}}} = \\frac{1}{V} \\left ( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T} \\right ) _{P}\n\\]\nThe volume of a orthorhombic system can be calculated as: \\[\nV = a\\cdot b \\cdot c\n\\] In general, the volume of a non-orthorhombic crystal sytems is calculated as: \\[\nV = a b c \\sqrt{1-\\mathrm{cos}^2(\\alpha) -\\mathrm{cos}^2(\\beta) - \\mathrm{cos}^2(\\gamma)+ 2(\\mathrm{cos}(\\alpha) \\mathrm{cos}(\\beta) \\mathrm{cos}(\\gamma))}\n\\]\nThe interaction energy is a measurement to estimate the energy share of interaction between the guest and host system. It can be calculated by substracting the single energy shares of the individual systems (\\(U_{\\mathrm{guest}}\\) and \\(U_{\\mathrm{host}}\\)) from the energy of the total system (\\(U_{\\mathrm{guest@host}}\\)): \\[\nU_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\left< U_{\\mathrm{guest@host}} \\right > - \\left< U_{\\mathrm{host}} \\right > -  \\left< U_{\\mathrm{guest}} \\right >.\n\\]\nFor this, you take the average total energy \\(U=E_{\\mathrm{kin}}+U_{\\mathrm{pot}}\\) of the respective simulated system (guest@host, host, guest) from a long enough equilibrated trajectory.\nThe radial distribution function (RDF) is a simple measurement to get structural information of the system.\nIt describes the probability \\(P_{ab}(r)\\) to find a target particle type \\(b\\) at distance \\(r\\) away from a reference particle type \\(a\\); e.g. the probability to find \\(\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{O}_2\\) from \\(\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}\\) clusters at distance \\(r\\): \\[\nP_{ab}(r) = \\int_{0}^{r'} 4\\pi r'^2 g_{ab}(r') dr'\n\\] where \\(g_{ab}(r)\\) is the RDF. The RDF formulates the average local density \\(\\left <\\rho_{ab}(r)\\right >\\) normalized by \\(\\rho=(N_a N_b)\\) \\[\ng(r) = \\frac{\\left <\\rho_{ab}(r)\\right >}{\\rho}.\n\\]\nThe two-particle density correlation function is defined as:\n\\[\n\\rho_{ab}(r) =\\sum_{i=1}^{N_a} \\sum_{j=1}^{N_b} \\left < \\delta(|\\vec{r_{i}}-\\vec{r_{j}}| -r)\\right >.\n\\]\nThe average number of particles \\(b\\) that can be found in the shell of distance \\(r\\) can be determined by multiplying the density \\(\\rho\\) with the probability \\(G(r)\\) \\[\nN_{ab}(r) = \\rho G_{ab}(r)\n\\]\nIn order to describe the dynamic of guests in host systems, it is necessary to calculate transport properties. A transport property would be for example the diffusion, viscosity, electrical or thermal conductivity.\nIn general, transport properties can be described as a property coefficient \\(\\gamma\\) which depends on microscopic variable \\(A\\) (e.g. positions \\(\\Delta \\vec{r}\\) or the velocities \\(\\vec{v}\\)) that is written as an infinite time integration of a non-normalized time correlation function \\(\\left < \\dot{A}(t)\\dot{A}(t_0) \\right >\\) : \\[\n\\gamma = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} dt \\left < \\dot{A}(t)\\dot{A}(t_0) \\right >.\n\\] This is also known as Green-Kubo relation1 which can also written as the equivalent Einstein expression\n\\[\n\\gamma = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\left < (A(t) - A(t_0))^2 \\right >}{2t} = \\frac{1}{2} \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{d}{dt} \\left < (A(t) - A(t_0))^2 \\right >\n\\]\nIn case of self-diffusion coefficient \\(D_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) the variable \\(A\\) is the molecular position \\(\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{cm}}\\) which in general is the center of mass position of the particles: \\[\n\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{cm}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\vec{r}_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i}\n\\] where \\(m_i\\) is the atomic mass, \\(\\vec{r}_i\\) is the atomic positions and \\(N\\) the number of atoms in the particle.\nAs well as \\(\\dot{A}\\) is the molecular velocity which should be also considered as center of mass.\nThe diffusion coefficient is directly depending on the activation energy \\(E_{\\mathrm{a}}\\) by an exponential decacy \\[\nD_{\\mathrm{s}}=D_0 e^{-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{RT}}\n\\] where \\(D_0\\) is factor of the exponential function, \\(R=8.3145\\,\\mathrm{JK^{-1}mol^{-1}}\\) is the ideal gas constant and \\(T\\) is the temperature.\nWith this formalism we can apply an Arrhenius equation to fit a linear function to get the activation energy \\(E_{\\mathrm{a}}\\). \\[\n\\ln (D_{\\mathrm{s}}) = -\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{RT} + \\ln{D_0}\n\\]"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThis guide is for people new to Linux. The aim of this documents is to help with everyday challenges when working with Linux systems. Generally, manual pages (e.g. man sed gives the terminal manual of sed) are almost everytime helpful and also -h (or --help) flags after commands quickly display helpful information. Obviously, the internet often helps as well and most of the time new things are learned doing. A good overview of the command line interface on linux is on the following github repository (there is also a german version, but reading the english one is recommended):\nhttps://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line\n\n\nProbably most used linux commands:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommand [options]\ndescription\n\n\n\n\ncd /path/to/directory\nChange to directory\n\n\nmkdir [options] directory\nCreate a new directory\n\n\ntouch filename\nCreate an empty file with the specified name\n\n\ncp [options] source destination\nCopy files and directories\n\n\nmv [options] source destination\nRename or move file(s) or directories\n\n\nls [options]\nList directory contents\n\n\npwd\nDisplay the pathname for the current directory\n\n\nrm [options] directory\nRemove (delete) file(s) and/or directories\n\n\nrm -r [options] directory\nDelete directories\n\n\ncat [filename]\nDisplay file’s contents to the standard output device\n\n\nless [options] [filename]\nView the contents of a file one page at a time\n\n\ntail [options] [filename]\nDisplay the last n lines of a file (the default is 10)\n\n\nhead [options] [filename]\nDisplay the first n lines of a file (the default is 10)\n\n\ngrep [options] pattern [filesname]\nSearch files or output for a particular pattern\n\n\nchmod [options] mode filename\nChange a file’s permissions (u+x to make executable)\n\n\nfind [pathname] [expression]\nSearch for files matching a provided pattern.\n\n\nsort [options] file\nsort the file via [option]\n\n\nps [options]\nDisplay a snapshot of the currently running processes\n\n\ntop\nDisplays the resources being used on your system. Press q to exit\n\n\nkill [options] pid\nStop a process. If the process refuses to stop, use kill -9 pid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore commands are:\n\n\nBasic Linux Commands (modified version of source: here)\n\n\ncommand [options]\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nman [command]\nDisplay the help information for the specified command\n\n\necho [options]\nPrint string, variable, etc.\n\n\ntar [options] filename\nStore and extract files from a tarfile (.tar) or tarball (.tar.gz or .tgz)\n\n\nbc\nbasic calculator (e.g. echo “3+2”| bc \\(\\;\\) gives 5 for floats use flag -l)\n\n\nchown [options] filename\nChange who owns a file\n\n\nclear\nClear a command line screen/window for a fresh start\n\n\ndate [options]\nDisplay or set the system date and time\n\n\ndf [options]\nDisplay used and available disk space\n\n\ndu [options]\nShow how much space each file takes up\n\n\nln [options] source [destination]\nCreate a shortcut.\n\n\nlocate filename\nSearch a copy of your filesystem for the specified filename.\n\n\npasswd [name [password]]\nChange the password\n\n\nssh [options] user@machine\nRemotely log in to another Linux machine, over the network\n\n\nwho [options]\nDisplay who is logged on\n\n\n> [oufile]\nWrite stdout (text written to terminal) to outfile (e.g. dftb+ > dftb.out)\n\n\n\n\nYou can use Tab for autocompletion of commands.\nCommands can usually be combined with the pipe: |. To write a pipe press Alt Gr + <|>-key (usually located on the left of Y on German keyboards) in between. For example:\n    grep \"Done\" dftb.out | cat -n     \nTo send your job to the background, stop it with CTRL+Z and then enter bg. Afterwards, you can logout with CTRL+D and the process will still be running (can be observed with top when relogging in) after you closed the terminal.\nOn the desktop computers in the office you can search the history with PageUp and PageDown keys. The prefix you entered will then be autocompleted by searching in the history for matching commands you entered before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you want quick access to files or directories in your home folder, the ~-symbol is an alias for your home directory /home/user (= \\$HOME).\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to: edit files\nFor editing files you can use any editor that you like e.g.:\n\nVSCode (code)\nnedit\ngedit\nEmacs (emacs)\n\nFor quick changes in files vim is a good option as it runs in the terminal (no -X in ssh required). To learn the basic commands the vimtutor (just type \"vimtutor\" in your terminal) is highly recommended. To exit vim, just type :q and Enter.\n\nVim cheat sheet\n\n\n\nHow to: gawk\nBasic usage of gawk:\ngawk '{ [commands] }' file\nExample: print the first and third column of the file example.dat. Be sure to add some spaces in between the columns using \"   \":\ngawk '{print $1\"   \"$3}' example.dat\nExample: print the first column and \\(500*x^2\\) of the first column column of the file x.dat to calculate a harmonic potential and output then data to the file potential.dat:\ngawk '{print $1\"   \" 500*$1*$1}' x.dat > potential.dat\nFor more advanced usage, also printf and if/else statements can be used similar in the language C. And sed (see below) can be used to substitute characters with white spaces which then generate new columns that can be printed with gawk.\n\n\nHow to: sed\nBasic usage of sed:\nsed -flags '[commands]' file\nExample: every occurrence (g for global at the end) of \"apple\" in fruit.dat will be substituted (s at the beginning) by \"banana\":\nsed 's/apple/banana/g' fruit.dat\nTo extract lines between two strings (print every line between \"pear\" and \"kiwi\"), use:\nsed '/pear/,/kiwi/p' fruit.dat\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that symbols, numbers, words, strings can be replaced with a white space (\" \") to separate columns which can be printed with gawk. The combination of sed and gawk is very powerful!\n\n\n\n\nHow to: for-loops in bash\nA simple for loop looks like:\nfor i in [list]\n    do \n    [commands]\n    done \nFor every item in [list] the commands between the lines do and done will be executed. For example to print all the items in the fruit list:\nfor i in pear banana apple\n    do \n    echo $i\n    done \nor print a sequence of numbers (here 1-10):\nfor i in $(seq 1 1 10)\n    do \n    echo $i\n    done \nor iterate over output files (here grep for the Total Energy of a QM calculation):\nfor i in $(ls *.out)\n    do \n    grep \"Total Energy\" $i\n    done \n\n\nHow to: ssh & scp\nNote the ~ symbol is an alias for /home/\\$USER where \\$USER is your username. To connect with a remote pc via ssh (no colon!)\n\nssh username@remote_host  \nTo enable streaming of windows (e.g. nedit) to your computer add -X (when accessing from home, -CY might be faster and more stable):\nssh -X username@remote_host  \nCopy file from a remote host to local host (your computer):\nscp   username@from_host:one_file.txt   some/folder/\nCopy file from local host (your computer) to a remote host:\nscp   one_file.txt   username@to_host:/some/folder/\nCopy directory from a remote host to local host:\nscp -r   username@from_host:/some/folder/    other/folder/\nCopy directory from local host to a remote host:\nscp -r   some/folder/   username@to_host:/other/folder/\nThe use of rsync is recommended. See:\nhttps://www.tecmint.com/rsync-local-remote-file-synchronization-commands/\nTo login into remote computers without password authentication run ssh-keygen (just press Enter a few times) and ssh-copyid $USER@$HOST and enter the password. This is especially convenient for accessing the clusters.\n\n\nAppendix: Vim Cheat Sheet\n\n\n\n\nVim Cheat Sheet"

For example:\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\nfor fruit in fruits:\n  print(fruit)\nThis will output each fruit in the list, one at a time.\nWhile loops are used to repeat a block of code while a certain condition is true. For example:\nx = 0\nwhile x < 5:\n  print(x)\n  x += 1\nThis will output the numbers 0 through 4, one at a time."

You can then call the function using the name of the function followed by parentheses containing any arguments.
